# Wizard Engine
A game engine library, responsible to provide an easy and flexible toolchain with all necessary technical solutions for a game.

This library could also be used for developing a software, which need to support only few tools from actual library. 
For example, maybe you just want to build your own 3D modelling software and you don't really care about game stuff? 
Well, in this case, WizardEngine can also feet your needs, as it can provide you lightweigth functions to include ot exclude any kind of systems that you want.

Right now, this library is aimed only for "single player" games. It means, that network systems are not super priority at least right now.
